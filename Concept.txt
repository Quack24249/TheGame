My new concept for the game:

Dungeon crawling rougelike with proximity voice-chat.
The most important part of the concept being the proximity voice chat and keeping the maps dark in order to increase chaos.
Lots of inspiration from Lethal Company.

Other ideas:

Day/Might cycle - monsters increase at night
you can choose to camp outside of the dungeon or inside but camping is never safe
rest bars - you have to take turns guarding camp -  either inside the dungeon or outside of it

Make it based around guilds, ie you join a guild with your friends and thats why you explore the dungeon 
You have a guild house you can return to and upgrade

Encourage solo play - individual random missions - it is not good when everyone just sticks together no matter what, 
encourage random experiences and interesting gameplay

Very rare (1%) enemy mission where you attempt to sabotage your guild

If all members of the guild die you have to restart the save, but dying should be much harder than in Lethal Company
In 3 hour playthrough expect one full restart

Dead players have sommething to do - ghost mining crystals or something idk yet

Different roles/weapons -> magic swords summons etc gunslinger
