THIS TIME WE DO IT FOR REAL

I believe I was using Unreal Enginer or GoDot.
GoDot is free and open-source, but it seems a little more limited than Unreal.
Personally, I would like to use GoDot, as I like the idea of using an open-source platform to develop.

Pops will join the repository and we will start smurfing on creating this game.
